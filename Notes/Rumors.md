[[Rekanar]] (17) - There is a [[Moathouse Ruin]] in the east. Must be wealth from long ago there.

[[Rekanar]] (11) - [[Black Jay]] (herdsman) is in league with local bandits. Tips them off when likely score passes through.

[[Zayla]] (12) - [[Yâ€™Dey]], female (head cleric, [[St. Cuthbert]]) disappeared under mysterious circumstances. [[Terjon]] is closed-mouth about it. May have had something to do with it. ([[Terjon]] is in charge now)
